# ðŸ”¬ Multi-Scale Data Collection App for Olympus Microscope

This MATLAB-based application enables **multi-scale tracking and image capturing** of blood smear slides using Olympus microscopes. The app is designed specifically for **educational and research purposes**, allowing users to track a **1000x blood patch** at lower magnifications (100x and 400x), and collect labeled data efficiently.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- âœ… **Multi-scale slide tracking** at 100x, 400x, and 1000x magnifications.
- âœ… Manual entry of **approximate X, Y coordinates** for precise patch tracking.
- âœ… Support for image acquisition, preview, and saving for dataset generation.
- âœ… Designed with **MATLAB App Designer** (Tested on MATLAB 2019a).
- âœ… Utilizes:
  - **Image Acquisition Toolbox**
  - **Image Processing Toolbox**
  - **Computer Vision Toolbox**
